# conforming-subdivision

This project is a visualization of the conforming subdivision algorithm from "A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Shortest Paths Among Curved Obstacles in the Plane" written by John Hershberger, Subhash Suri, and Hakan Yildiz, and was first introduced in the paper "An Optimal Algorithm for Euclidean Shortest Paths in the Plane" by John Hershberger and Subhash Suri. The conforming subdivision is an essential, complicated first step for achieving O(nlogn) computation of shortest paths among obstacles in the plane, and it also has other applicatinos discussed in the introduction to the latter paper. This visualization is limited to circular obstacles. 

## Usage

Simply clone the repository and run 'pyglet_main.py' in Python. The dependencies are: pyglet, networkx, and shapely.
